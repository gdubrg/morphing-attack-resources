## Code, data and model collection publicly available

### D-MAD models
- *A double siamese framework for differential morphing attack detection* (Borghi et al., Sensors 2021) [paper](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/21/10/3466)
  - Code: Python, PyTorch
  - [Resource](https://github.com/ndido98/siamese)
  - Notes: official implementation, tested on FVC (on going)
    
- *Deep Face Representations for Differential Morphing Attack Detection* (Scherag et al., TIFS 2020)
  - Code: Python, PyTorch, MXNet
  - [Resource](https://github.com/gdubrg/MAD-Tools)
  - Notes: unofficial implementation, tested on FVC (MORPHDB_D-1.0 EER = 0.0%)

### S-MAD models
- *UBO-SMAD-R3: an Inception-ResNet-based model for Single-image Morphing Attack Detection*
  - Code: Python, PyTorch
  - [Resource](https://github.com/ndido98/ubo-smad-r3)
  - Notes: tested on FVC-onGoing (SOTAMD_D-1.0 EER = 10.33%)
